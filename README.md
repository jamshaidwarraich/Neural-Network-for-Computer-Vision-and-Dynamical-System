Neural Network for Dynamical Systems
Welcome to the "Neural Network for Dynamical Systems" repository!

In this repository, you'll find codes for solving various kinds of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) using Neural Networks (NN). Below is a brief overview of the specific codes available:

Neural Network for CIFAR 10 Data: Contains codes related to neural network implementations for the CIFAR 10 dataset.

Solving ODE by NN: Includes codes for solving different ODEs by adjusting the parameters of neural networks.

Financial Maths ODE Models: Builds upon the previous section, focusing on solving specific models from financial mathematics using neural networks.

CNN Complete Codes: This section covers comprehensive code implementations of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It involves working with various datasets from TensorFlow Keras, along with experimentation on CNN structures to evaluate network accuracy.
